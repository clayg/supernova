The data in the file is exactly the same as the environment variables which you would normally use when running novaclient.  You can copy/paste from your novarc files directly into configuration sections within `~/.supernova`.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of two environments, **production** and **development**:\r\n\r\n    [production]\r\n    NOVA_URL=http://production.nova.example.com:8774/v1.1/\r\n    NOVA_VERSION=1.1\r\n    NOVA_USERNAME = jsmith\r\n    NOVA_API_KEY = fd62afe2-4686-469f-9849-ceaa792c55a6\r\n    NOVA_PROJECT_ID = nova-production\r\n\r\n    [development]\r\n    NOVA_URL=http://dev.nova.example.com:8774/v1.1/\r\n    NOVA_VERSION=1.1\r\n    NOVA_USERNAME = jsmith\r\n    NOVA_API_KEY = 40318069-6069-4d9f-836d-a46df17fc8d1\r\n    NOVA_PROJECT_ID = nova-production\r\n\r\nWhen you use *supernova*, you'll refer to these environments as **production** and **development**.  Every environment is specified by its configuration header name.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n    supernova [environment] [novaclient arguments...]\r\n\r\nFor example, if you wanted to run a list in the **production** environment:\r\n\r\n    supernova production list\r\n\r\nShow a particular instance's data in the preprod environment:\r\n\r\n    supernova preprod show 3edb6dac-5a75-486a-be1b-3b15fd5b4ab0a\r\n\r\nThe first argument is the environment argument and it is expected to be a single word without spaces. Any text after the environment argument is passed directly to novaclient.\r\n\r\n#### A brief note about environment variables\r\n\r\n*supernova* will only replace and/or append environment variables to the already present variables for the duration of the novaclient executation. If you have `NOVA_USERNAME` set outside the script, it won't be used in the script since the script will pull data from `~/.supernova` and use it to run novaclient. In addition, any variables which are set prior to running *supernova* will be left unaltered when the script exits.\r\n","google":"","tagline":"Use novaclient with multiple OpenStack nova environments the easy way"}
